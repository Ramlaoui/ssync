# Job Refresh State Improvements

## Summary
Implemented clear visual indicators and proper cache invalidation for the job refresh mechanism in the ssync web UI.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Host Status Indicators** (`HostStatusIndicator.svelte`)
- Shows real-time status for each host:
  - üîÑ Blue spinner: Currently refreshing
  - ‚úÖ Green checkmark: Fresh data (< 1 minute old)
  - üïê Yellow clock: Stale data (> 1 minute old)
  - ‚ùå Red alert: Connection error
- Displays time since last update (e.g., "2m ago", "Just now")
- Available in compact (icon only) and full (with text) modes

### 2. **Per-Host Refresh Buttons**
- Added refresh button to each host in JobList component
- Allows refreshing individual hosts without affecting others
- Visual feedback during refresh operation

### 3. **Proper Cache Bypass**
- Force refresh now clears all cached data before fetching
- Ensures fresh data from SLURM on manual refresh
- Progressive loading still works but with cleared cache

### 4. **WebSocket Status & Manual Reconnect** (`WebSocketStatus.svelte`)
- Shows WebSocket connection status
- Manual reconnect button for immediate reconnection
- Connection quality monitoring with retry logic
- Compact mode for navigation bar integration

### 5. **Store Improvements** (`jobs.ts`)
- Added `refreshHost()` method for individual host refresh
- Force refresh clears cache completely
- Better handling of host loading states
- Preserved data on WebSocket disconnection

## Usage

### For Users
1. **Check Host Status**: Look at the indicator next to each host name
   - Green = Fresh, Yellow = Stale, Red = Error, Blue = Refreshing
2. **Refresh Individual Host**: Click the refresh icon next to any host
3. **Force Refresh All**: Click the main refresh button in the header
4. **WebSocket Reconnect**: Click the WiFi icon to manually reconnect

### For Developers
```typescript
// Force refresh all hosts (clears cache)
await jobsStore.fetchAllJobsProgressive(true);

// Refresh specific host
await jobsStore.refreshHost('hostname');

// Check host status
const hostState = jobsStore.getHostLoadingState('hostname');
```

## Visual Examples

**Fresh Data (< 1 minute)**
```
üñ•Ô∏è hostname (42 jobs)     ‚úÖ Updated Just now [üîÑ]
```

**Stale Data (> 1 minute)**
```
üñ•Ô∏è hostname (42 jobs)     üïê Updated 5m ago [üîÑ]
```

**Currently Refreshing**
```
üñ•Ô∏è hostname (42 jobs)     üîÑ Refreshing... [üîÑ]
```

**Connection Error**
```
üñ•Ô∏è hostname (42 jobs)     ‚ùå Connection error [üîÑ]
```

## Benefits
1. **Transparency**: Users know exactly which data is fresh vs cached
2. **Control**: Can refresh individual hosts or all at once
3. **Reliability**: Manual WebSocket reconnect for network issues
4. **Performance**: Progressive loading with clear status indicators
5. **User Experience**: No confusion about refresh state

## Technical Details
- Cache durations are intelligent based on job state (completed = 5min, running = 1-2min)
- WebSocket uses exponential backoff for reconnection (1s, 2s, 4s... max 30s)
- Host error states trigger faster retry (10s vs 60s)
- All updates use batched rendering to prevent UI flicker
