echo "Testing Script History Feature Fix"
echo "==================================="
echo ""
echo "The script history feature has been fixed:"
echo ""
echo "1. PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:"
echo "   - The ScriptHistory component's loading state was stuck because"
echo "     loadScriptHistory() wasn't being called when the modal opened"
echo "   - The onMount lifecycle only checked if isOpen was true initially,"
echo "     but isOpen starts as false"
echo ""
echo "2. FIXES APPLIED:"
echo "   a) Added reactive statement to load history when modal opens:"
echo "      \$: if (isOpen && loading && scripts.length === 0) {"
echo "        loadScriptHistory();"
echo "      }"
echo ""
echo "   b) Fixed API response handling:"
echo "      - The /api/status endpoint returns List[JobStatusResponse]"
echo "      - Each JobStatusResponse has hostname and jobs array"
echo "      - Updated to correctly extract jobs from the response structure"
echo ""
echo "   c) Added error handling:"
echo "      - Display error messages if loading fails"
echo "      - Added retry button for failed loads"
echo "      - Console logging for debugging"
echo ""
echo "3. TO TEST:"
echo "   - Open the Launch Jobs page"
echo "   - Click the 'History' button in the script editor"
echo "   - The modal should now load and display job scripts"
echo "   - Check browser console for debug messages"
echo ""
echo "4. EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:"
echo "   - Loading spinner appears briefly"
echo "   - Jobs are fetched from configured hosts (jz, adastra, entalpic)"
echo "   - Scripts are displayed in a grid layout"
echo "   - Clicking a script loads it into the editor"
